## Transition from passwords to passkeys

Passkeys offer a **safer** and **more seamless** alternative to traditional passwords.
Based on public key cryptography, passkeys authenticate users using device-bound credentials such as biometrics or
device PINs — without transmitting shared secrets.
This approach significantly enhances both security and user experience across platforms.
